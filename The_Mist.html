<p>Everything I do is grounded in collaboration, when sharing knowledge and skills with others I believe the very best, most significant work can be created.<br><br>
	
Through co-creation and ideation I can generate a diverse range of concepts, following this I analyse these ideas through testing and iteration. I always design with real people in mind, ensuring changes meet their needs, so involving those who commission work throughout the process is crucial to my practice.<br><br>

Recently I created an album artwork cover in collaboration with Lost Twin. We worked using the <i alt="Cadavre exquis is similar to the old parlour game consequences – in which players write in turn on a sheet of paper, fold to conceal what they have written, and pass it on to the next player – but adapted so that parts of the body are drawn instead.

It was invented in 1925 in Paris by the surrealists Yves Tanguy, Jacques Prévert, André Breton and Marcel Duchamp. The name ‘cadavre exquis’ was derived from a phrase that resulted when they first played the game, ‘le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau’ (‘the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine’).

Cadavre exquis as a drawing approach has been used by other artists since the surrealists notably the YBA artists Jake and Dinos Chapman.">Exquisite Corpse</i> method, resulting in the coming together of both of our visions, firstly for me as a listener and secondly, for Lost Twin as the artist.</p></div>
