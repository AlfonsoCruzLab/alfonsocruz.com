          I believe to achieve the best results we need to continuously question and challenge our own assumptions, so I approach design by always staying curious and exploring without limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of this methodology is a study I carried out asking: how AI understands genetics? This project subverted the filter app FaceApp into an image generator rather than an editing tool. By feeding the software with minimum information it was forced to create autonomously by filling in the missing data. 
        </p>
        <img class="breakout" src="/images/Formulate_3x2.png" alt="Subverting FaceApp">
        <p>
          The result was a series of photorealistic portraits of people who don’t exist.
        </p>
        <img class="breakout" src="/images/Formulate_3x2.png" alt="Subverting FaceApp">
        <p>
          I also applied this approach of creating images by feeding AI with reduced information to a commercial project. Tomorrow’s Dawn Quartet, a band, asked me to create an artwork for their Zredzred Remixes. The album is a reinterpretation of their Desert album by other artists.

          Since August 2020, we’ve been battling against the development of Hondo’s ‘Enormo Tower,’ an enormous 20 storey office tower which will boost gentrification, pushing prices up and displacing residents and traders. Our campaign is called #FightTheTower.  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FightTheTower" target="blank">#FightTheTower</a>.
