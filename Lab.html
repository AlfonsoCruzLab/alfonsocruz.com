<p>My approach to design is rooted in curiosity and the innate need to explore without limits. I believe to achieve the best results we need to continuously question and challenge our own assumptions.<br><br>

I use my curiosity to gather rich insight into each concept I work on, always applying analysis and design processes to craft what I have learnt into tangible insights that can be used to fuel change.</p>
