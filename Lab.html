          I believe to achieve the best results we need to continuously question and challenge our own assumptions, so I approach design by always staying curious and exploring without limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example of this methodology is a study I carried out asking: how AI understands genetics? This project subverted the filter app FaceApp into an image generator rather than an editing tool. By feeding the software with minimum information it was forced to create autonomously by filling in the missing data. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The result was a series of photorealistic portraits of people who don’t exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also applied this approach of creating images by feeding AI with reduced information to a commercial project. Tomorrow’s Dawn Quartet, a band, asked me to create an artwork for their Zredzred Remixes. The album is a reinterpretation of their Desert album by other artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remixed the previous artwork by slicing it into nine images and reworking them individually.
        </p>

		<p>
          First, I compressed each of these new images to 16-bit files, which were then run by an upscaling software that generated a series of abstractions.
        </p>

          These worked individually but also formed the new album’s cover when brought back into the 3 x 3 grid.
