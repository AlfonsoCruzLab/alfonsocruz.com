<p>I have an MA in Graphic Communication Design from Central Saint Martins (University of the Arts London) and a Licenciatura (BA + MA) in Fine Arts and Design from the University of Barcelona.<br><br>
	
I have a background in Fine Arts, Art Direction and
Design and 10+ years of experience designing
concept-lead visual narratives.<br><br>
	
My aim as a designer is to appropriate the experience
and skills Iâ€™ve gained from commercial projects and
channel them into social causes and projects that
contribute to meaningful conversations.<br><br><br>
