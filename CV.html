<p>I have an MA in Graphic Communication Design from
Central Saint Martins (University of the Arts London)
and a Licenciatura (BA + MA) in Fine Arts and Design
from the University of Barcelona.<br><br>
	
I have 10+ years of experience designing concept-lead
visual narratives across Graphic Design, Art Direction
and Creative Campaigning<br><br>
	
My aim as a designer is to appropriate the experience
and skills I’ve gained from commercial projects and
channel them into social causes and projects that
contribute to meaningful conversations.<br><br><br>
