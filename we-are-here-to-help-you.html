          Mental health awareness is currently at its highest, marked by days, weeks and months on the calendar. This is the achievement of the many campaigns led by public and private institutions, and the hundreds of charities built around these issues. The shared goal is to erase the stigma around mental health disorders and encourage people to seek help.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what happens when support is sought? What resources are available, and how do we access them?

          <b>We are here to help you</b> is a series of projects in which I revisit my personal experience applying for mental health aid from public services in the UK. It starts by translating the journey into a flowchart and then zooms in progressively through different lenses of graphical analysis.

          The umbrella line of enquiry ‘how did aid-seeking become detrimental’ was navigated through sub-queries led by the findings of each investigation method.

          The foundation of the research is a flowchart that tracks the route I followed to access treatment. It includes the organisations, people and procedures I encountered across the application process, providing a bird’s-eye view of the journey and its ramifications.
