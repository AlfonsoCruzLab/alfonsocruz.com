Cut from recycled polyester-blend cloth with canvas and trims that have been consciously chosen for their low impact on the environment.<br><br>
    Even better, it doesn’t compromise on quality. Same great handle, same great tailoring, less plastic in landfill. In a small, limited-edition run that allows us to test, learn and eliminate unnecessary waste.<br><br>
    <span class="largefont">Because we all have to make smarter&nbsp;choices.</span></div></div>

It takes decades, if not centuries, to break down and releases harmful toxins as it does. Mismanaged waste injures and kills our wildlife and spreads disease among the communities where it’s dumped or left uncollected.<br>

	<div class="features" style="background-image:url(DeconstructedSuit_Cloth.jpg)" id="how">Cloth<br><span class="largefont">Saving up to 45 plastic bottles from landfill<br>—</span><br><br>The Eco Suit’s cloth is woven with recycled polyester that reuses plastic bottles that would otherwise end up in landfill. Its fibres are certified to not give off harmful chemicals and, importantly, it feels as good to wear as virgin polyester (and maybe even better with the feel-good factor). Inside, we’ve lined the Eco Suit with fabric that’s a minimum of 99% post-consumer recycled polyester.</div>
	<div class="features" style="background-image:url(DeconstructedSuit_Inners.jpg)">Inners<br><span class="largefont">Good on the inside<br>—</span><br><br>There’s a lot more to a suit than its cloth. We’ve put the time in finding a factory that makes the Eco Suit’s shoulder pad, canvas, sleeve head roll and chest foam using sustainable manufacturing processes that are REACH-compliant. It all adds up.</div>
	<div class="features" style="background-image:url(DeconstructedSuit_Details.jpg)">Details<br><span class="largefont">Details matter – truly<br>—</span><br><br>Every detail of our eco suit has been consciously chosen for its low impact on the environment. The thread is made from 100% recycled polyester yarns. Corozo nut buttons are a 100% natural material that’s durable, renewable and biodegradable. Even the pocketing fabric is OEKO-TEX® certified as free of chemical dye.</div>
	<div class="features" style="background-image:url(DeconstructedSuit_Hero.jpg); padding-bottom: 50vh;">Packaging<br><span class="largefont">Good things come in good packages<br>—</span><br><br>We’ve used recycled materials wherever possible and as much as possible, from 100% recycled polyester-satin inner labels to recycled paper swing tickets and recyclable polybags.
	<br><br>As for suit bags, it turns out the most sustainable suit bag is actually one that lasts, so we made ours from high-grade canvas that’s robust enough to stand the test of time and will biodegrade when it’s done – keeping it out of landfill.</div>

The textile industry is one of the worst offenders for polluting the environment. Our goal is to reduce our impact anywhere we can. We’re committed to using our clout as a national retailer to close the loop and move towards sustainable manufacturing processes.
<br><br>
There’s a long way to go, but every step is one step closer. Here’s what we’re already doing and what we plan to do:<br><br>
<hr>
SUPPLIERS<br><br>
We’re using our relationships with our suppliers to minimise our impact on the environment. We’ll encourage them to use responsible manufacturing processes, harness greener energy and innovate in alternative materials that are kinder to the environment.<br><br>
We’re also partnering with fewer mills and makers so we can maintain closer relationships with them. Regular audits ensure our processes and logistics are compliant and help us identify new ways to move sustainable retailing forward.<br><br>
<hr>
PACKAGING & DISPLAY<br><br>
We’re committed to removing or finding sustainable alternatives for one-use plastics used in our packaging and labelling by 2025.<br><br>
We’re investigating recyclable or bio-degradable polybags. In the meantime, we’ve set our stores up with recycling bins to dispose of plastic polybags responsibly.<br><br>
We’re also looking into alternatives for plastic hangers. Until we find a better solution, we’ll ask our customers to think twice before taking hangers and reuse them in-store instead.<br><br>		
<hr>
CLOSING THE LOOP<br><br>
We’re working with ReGain, the clothing-recycling app that takes in your unwanted old clothes and rewards you with discounts for new ones.<br><br>
Up to 95% of post-consumer fashion that ReGain diverts from landfill is reused or recycled, with the remaining 5% going into energy production or upscaled into new clothes. It all adds up to the industry closing the loop and moving towards circular fashion.<br><br>
Any unsellable returns or faulty product will now be sent to ReGain to recycle, saving up to 7,200 units from being otherwise destroyed or ending up in landfill.
