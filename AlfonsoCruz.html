<p>Design is typically valued based on aesthetics or practicality but my methodology focuses on production and display.<br><br>

This is not just from an environmental approach but also to create a viable system of understandable tools that enables brands to confidently present themselves in new ways.<br><br>

For example the web page you are viewing is cleaner than 99% of web pages tested at https://www.websitecarbon.com/<br><br>

More data means more carbon emissions.The internet is responsible for 3.7% of carbon emissions globally (the same as worldwide air traffic) and uses more electricity annually than the UK—this amount is predicted to double by 2025¹. I strive to create designs that actively go in the opposite direction without compromising quality or creativity.<br><br>
